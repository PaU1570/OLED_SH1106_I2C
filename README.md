# SH1106_I2C
Driver Library For SH1106 Based Oled Displays (using I2C)

SH1106 is very similar to SSD1306 and is used in many cheaper oled displays (from ebay, aliexpress etc.) instead of SSD1306 (used by Adafruit original OLED displays).

It's command set is very similar, but not identical to SSD1306
